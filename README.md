### Using Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the median cost of housing in San-Francisco


In this notebook, I implement a Machine Learning Pipeline to extract, pre-process and transform data on houses in San-Francisco before implementing 3 different ML agorithms on them.

# Algorithms Implemented
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forests
3. Decision Trees
